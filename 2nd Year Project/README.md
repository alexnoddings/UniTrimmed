    <h1>EduLocate Project</h1>
</p>

EduLocate was a 2nd Year University project to create a system for parents and prospective students to view information about nearby schools. 

It uses a Xamarin front-end which runs on both Android and Windows (iOS could not be supported as a Mac was not provided) which communicates using a Web API with a backend server. This server was populated with data generated using the tooling.

Both the `Main` and `Tooling` directories were separate repositories during development, but have been merged into one for archiving.
