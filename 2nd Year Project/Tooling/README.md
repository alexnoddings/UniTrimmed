	<p>2nd Year University Project - 2018/19</p>

This repository contains the tooling used for data-processing. 

The government website provides huge (somewhat inconsistent) data sets on schools which was leveraged for the project. These tools were used to process the raw excel data into more meaningful information, such as locations, website links, and social media links.
